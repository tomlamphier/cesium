## Martial Arts Notebook
My name is Tom Lamphier.  I'm a first degree black
belt in Hapkido and a Purple belt in Kumite Ryu Jujitsu.
My two teachers are Sabunim David Herbert of the World Martial Arts Center 
in Brooklyn, NY and Professor
Dominick Briochê of the Kunite Ryu School of 
Survival, also in Brooklyn.  I began my martial arts journey
in 2005.

Taking up martial arts was one of my best decisions.    It
has certainly helped me stay in good physical condition
through the years, but that's only part of it.  To me,
martial arts involves the mind, the body, and the spirit.  And as you study it, you develop qualities that spill
over into your life outside of martial arts.  

It's almost a cliché to say that martial arts is a journey.  Yet that 
description resonates with me at this point, years after
I started.  I've done things I never thought I 
could;  I felt the highs and lows of being a student; I've 
met facinating and talented people; I had the exceptional 
good fortune to have had two great teachers.  If it's been a 
journey, it's been a wonderful one.  Best of all, I'm 
still on that road. 

Keeping a martial arts notebook is important.  If you write down 
forms and techniques as you learn them, you 
can refresh your memory later on when you 
want to practice them.  So a notebook is first of all
a memory helper.  

Another reason for writing notes is that it helps 
clarify what you are learning.  The effort of 
putting things down in words engages your mind, 
enabling you to make connections that help you understand
the deeper aspects of what you are doing.

A well-maintained notebook can be a source of 
encouragement.  By neatly collecting and organizing
material about martial arts, you develop a sense
of mastery.  The orderliness of a good notebook
is like maintaining a living space--just having 
a sense of order centers you and makes you stronger and 
more focused.

When you meet a martial arts master at a seminar or another event,
one of the first things they are likely to ask you 
is: *"Where is your notebook?"*  Hopefully you
have been keeping yours up to date and can reply,
*"I have it here!"*
