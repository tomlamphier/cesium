## Docker and Kubernetes Notebook
Docker and Kubernetes are increasingly popular platforms for running applications 
in containers.  For all that, it isn't evident how to use them on 
projects effectively.  The goal of this notebook is to help me gain a
working knowledge of these platforms.  There are plenty of books about them; the question is 
how to find time to read and absorb their lessons.  

This home page is noticeably sparse.  It reflects my limited knowledge of the subject.  I hope 
to remedy that in the next few months.
